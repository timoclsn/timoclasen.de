    "description": "Being a great UX designer begins and ends with being a great human. We can't pour an empty cup into another. We can’t lead others where we are not.\n\nThis UX podcast helps UX’ers become the best, most powerful designers (and humans) they can be. Yes, you'll discover how-to’s, but much more importantly you'll discover why-to’s.\n\nEvery episode is sure to inspire and equip you on how to better fight for your users and business, and dare I say change the world (even if only for one human at a time) in a much deeper and more tangible way than you ever thought possible.\n",
